Major changes in 0.10.10
========================

 * We now support yaml manifest as well as json.
 * New source type "svn" to download subversion checkouts.
 * New source type "dir" for local directories.
 * Set FLATPAK_BUILDER_N_JOBS in environment during build.
 * If not using ccache, enfore it of. This helps builds with
   meson as they pick up ccache by default, which makes no
   sense when there is no persistent storage for ccache to use.
 * New options prepend-*-path similar to the existing append-*-path
   ones, but prepending instead.
 * New argument --no-shallow-clone which disables any shallow clone
   optimizations.
 * New inherit-sdk-extensions property similar to inherit-extensions,
   but is not inherited in the platform.
 * We now ignore json keys starting with "//" and "__" allowing these
   to be used for comments.
 * Fixed a bug that caused --install to not work properly.
 * New argument --extension-tag for using the new tagged extension feature.
 * The build metadata now records which extensions were produced as part
   of a build.
 * New property add-build-extensions allows creating exension points that
   can be used during the build.
 * flatpak-builder --run now also binds /run/build-runtime to the builds,
   allowing it to work when building runtimes.

Major changes in 0.10.9
=======================

 * Support -y argument, which passes it on to flatpak install, etc
 * Fix build on glibc 2.27

Major changes in 0.10.8
=======================

 * Fix build on recent glibc

Major changes in 0.10.7
=======================

 * Add support for --socket=fallback-x11
 * Fix assert in --install
 * Fix --disable-updates for git sources
 * When mirroring git repos, use a temporary download dir
 * Support running flatpak-builder inside a flatpak sandbox

Major changes in 0.10.6
=======================

 * New checksum types for file/archive sources: md5, sha1, sha512
 * Support including source snippets from another file, similar to
   how module includes are supported.
 * The app id renaming in the appdata file is now more careful to
   avoid renaming other parts.
 * The cache default repo format for new caches is now bare-user-only
   which means building with flatpak-builder works on filesystems that
   don't support xattrs.
 * New --install argument will install the finished build using the
   new flatpak install install-directly-from-local-repo feature.
   This makes it easier to test local builds.

Major changes in 0.10.5
=======================

 * Add support for running tests during the build (disable with --disable-tests).
 * New build-option append-pkg-config to append to PKG_CONFIG_PATH
 * --state-dir option lets you reuse a single directory instead of scattered
   .flatpak-builder dirs for builds, downloads and cache data.

 * Don't fail if app ships both appdata and metainfo file
 * Support --log-system/session-bus in --run

Major changes in 0.10.4
=======================

 * Fixed source bundling of git repos with older versions of git
 * Allow git sources to use "HEAD" branch
 * Fixed crashes in some cases of git failure

   fsck during transfer when doing a shallow clone and the git version
   is less than 1.8.3.2.

Major changes in 0.10.2
=======================

 * Even more fixes for shallow git clones with older versions of git
 * New property for git sources, disable-shallow-clone which falls
   back to cloning the entire remote.

Major changes in 0.10.1
=======================

 * Fix handling of shallow git clones with older versions of git
 * Fix issue where flatpak-builder --run could exit if some
   thread in the parent process exited, exposeb by e.g.
   gnome-builder.

Major changes in 0.10.0
=======================

 * We now do shallow clones of git repos when downloading if

Major changes in 0.9.99
=======================

 * Fix git source bundling on older git version
 * New property: appdata-license lets you easily modify the appstream license field
 * New source type "extra-data" which makes it easier to use extra-data apps
 * We now automatically compress debuginfo unless the no-debuginfo-compression
   option is specified.
 * Appstream files called .metainfo.xml are now recognized.
 * New prepare-platform-commands property, similar to cleanup-platform-commands,
   but run before importing all the changes from the SDK.
 * We now apply all the deletions that happened in the SDK on the base when creating
   the platform.

Major changes in 0.9.98
=======================

 * build cache hits are now faster
 * git sources have a new property "tag" which works the same as "branch", but
   improves readability when referencing a git tag.
 * flatpak-builder --run now passes  --with-appdir which is useful when
   testing uninstalled builds.
 * When bundling git repos in .Sources we now make a shallow clone which uses
   a lot less space.
 * .Locale extensions now always set the new locale-subset property
 * locale-subset is supported in the add-extension property
 * build-options now also supports make-args and make-install args, which
   allows per-arch make flags.

======================

Skipped 0.9.10 to sync with flatpakk

 * Fix build on some arches due to lack of flatpak_get_kernel_arch symbol
 * Disable ostree 3% free space check for build cache
 * Add some new status terminal title updates
 * Set the requested environment vars in type=shell sources commands
 * Add append-path and append-ld-library-path build options
 * Add buildtype=qmake
 * Updated docs
